<section boxed><title>Let's Take a Walk</title>
<p>Joel and Ellie can walk <m>2</m> miles on each rainy day and <m>3</m> miles on each dry day. During the summer, they experienced <m>8</m> more rainy days than dry days and walked a total of <m>36</m> miles.</p>
  <problem>What are the two variables or unknown quantities in this problem? 
      <answer maxNumAttempts="2">
          <choice>The number of rainy days and miles walked on each rainy day.</choice>
          <choice>The number of dry days and miles walked on each dry day.</choice>
          <choice credit="1">The number of rainy days and the number of dry days.</choice>
